# The LinWang Ports

These are unofficial FreeBSD ports maintained by Gasol and the community. They
are a collection of PHP-related ports adapted from the official ports, with the
goal of maintaining legacy PHP and its extensions. In addition, this project
also provides a ports repository to distribute binary packages for ease of use.
This can save time if your machines would take hours to build from source, or
if you do not have enough resources to do so.

This project utilizes the [overlay support](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D21468)
in FreeBSD to build binary packages with [poudriere(8)]
